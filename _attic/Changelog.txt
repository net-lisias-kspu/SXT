0.3.23.7
	Thanks to github user @schnobs for this:
		Custom Drag Cube for SXTCargoBay1 (2.5m Cargo Bay)

	    The game sees the cargo bay as a hollow tube, giving it very
		little surface area. Drag-wise it does not line up with other
		2.5m parts, both leading and trailing 2.5m items have much
		higher drag than one would guess from looking at the vessel.
		The effect is comparable to inserting a modular girder or 
		I-beam into a 2.5m stack.

 	   This patch fixes the issue by giving the closed cargo bay the 
	   surface area of a (similar-sized) Rockomax-16 tank.
