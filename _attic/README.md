# SXTContinued
Lack's Stock eXTension 

IMPORTANT - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Some of the parts (see below) use some Squad textures.  Unfortunately, in 1.5, some
of the textures it uses have been moved into the zDeprecated directory, and are
not directly accessible during loading.  This causes some textures to be missing.

To address this, I've provided a pair of scripts, one to be used on Windows and
the other to be used on both Linux & OSX.  These only need to be run one time


Windows Instructions
====================
Open the SXT folder in Windows Explorer
Double-click on the file Windows_CopyTextures.bat (note that on most systems,
you won't see the .bat)


Linux & OSX Desktop Instructions
================================
Open the SXT folder 
Double-click on the file:  BashCopyTextures.sh


Linux & OSX Terminal Instructions
=================================
Change to the GameData/SXT directory
Type the following:
	bash BashCopyTextures.sh
	

Affected Parts
==============
LV-T80 "Robin" Liquid Fuel Engine
The hub and related pipes
3.75m Stage 3 Tank

This is a revival of the SXT - Stock eXTension mod, originally published by @Lack

Updated for 1.2.  The truck had some parts redone and works well, it includes the 
Bounce dll from the WorldCup mod (for the airbags), and RetractableLiftingSurface, 
which I wrote to support the folding wing.

Given the size of this mod, I'm sure there will be some issues.  Please let me know about 
them so that I can get them fixed.

A great shout out to @Deimos Rast for doing a lot of the early legwork
