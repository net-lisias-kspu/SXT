SXT - Stock eXTension :: Change Log

* 2015-1210: 24 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
	+ Major:
	+ Overhauled Osual parts. Textures now match Porkjet's style better and fixed the collsion meshes for the parts.
	+ Added ability to tweak deployment state of both Osual cockpit and loading ramp.
	+ Tweaked animation of ramp for more control over deployment state.
	+ Added Mk3-3.75m hollow adaptor.
	+ Added 3.75m Docking Port.
	+ Added 5m fairings and heatshield (re-sizes of stock parts, parameters).
	+ Minor:
	+ Finished updating part names, descriptions and manufacturers.
	+ Fixed nodes for 2.5m Cargo Bay.
	+ Further minor cfg fixes (thanks to Aivoh for pointing them out) - Correct name for ModuleCrossFeed and tabbing out of competitive agent mentality.
	+ Neatening up parts list. Deletion of defunct parts (old float cfgs).
	+ Fixes to heat tolerance for some plane parts.
* 2015-1202: 23.2 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
	+ Added 3.75m Docking Ring.
	+ Fixed Size 2 Cargo Bay nodes.
	+ Tweaks to part temperatures. Adding Skin/Int temps to some of the crew caps.
	+ Fixed Mk0 Barrel texture.
	+ Filled in a few missing part descriptions.
* 2015-1111: 23.1 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
	+ Added Electronic Fan (based off Airbus e-Fan).
	+ Added Small folding wing.
	+ Added Jumo 213 style Prop engine (KO-213 "Wolf").
	+ Added IVA for 5m Duna Hab and Clyde.
	+ Added 'Off-set' and 'Long XB-70' style 2.5m to Mk2 adaptor.
	+ Added 2.5m liquid-fuel tanks in similar style to Mk2/3 parts added.
	+ New model and stat tweaks for SXT 0.625m jet engine.
	+ Swapped configs/models for older parts that have been replaced with higher quality versions by Porkjet (e.g. 2.5m turbofan, Mk3 Ramp, Mk0 fuselage, Mk1 passenger cabin). Old craft using those parts should now replace them with the new stock equivalent.
	+ R-2800 prop will now look better when prop switches to blur (no more horrid blade mounts).
	+ Props will have altered stats/fuel requirements based on the presence or absence of FAR to account for different atmospheric properties (x1.8 static thrust without FAR).
	+ NK-12M spin-up time altered to fit real-life start-up better.
	+ NK-12M thrust curve altered. Should perform a bit closer to reality.
	+ RPM support added for Kossak & Entente.
	+ Edits to descriptions, crash-tolerances.
	+ Tweaks to stock aero-parts surface attachment settings.
	+ Fixes to stack node directions.
	+ Changed some part names to fit part order in list better (grouping with similar stock parts).
	+ Mystery Good can now satisfy satellite contracts (Kerbas-ad-astra).
* 2015-0911: 22.3 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0

* 2015-0804: 21 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
	+ Engines balanced to KSP 1.0+ values+attributes and given nick-names
	+ New prop engines (Powerful turboprop (NK-12M) and radial engine PW R-2800).
	+ Existing prop engine's efficiency balanced to match real-world fuel consumption (roughly, based off provided values of fuel consumption, converted into kg using gasoline's density and then into Liquid Fuel units) and fuel requirements at maximum throttle per hour flight listed in description
* 2015-0727: 20.8 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
	+ Updating engine configs, add missing nicknams as well.

* 2015-0724: 20.7 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
	+ Airbrakes updated (not sure about balance here)
	+ Beginning engine rebalances.
	+ Fixing inflatable balloons (1.0 doesn't like the old landing leg module).
	+ 8 thrustTransforms on the BA-8.
* 2015-0705: 20.6 (Signatum) for KSP 1.0
